# Customer-segmentation
A project to group customer into different segments based on spending score

Project Overview
Customer segmentation is a crucial tool for businesses to understand their customer base, tailor marketing strategies, and drive engagement. In this project, I used K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on key attributes such as Annual Income, Age, and Spending Score. By identifying distinct customer groups, businesses can develop personalized approaches to meet the needs of each segment, improve customer satisfaction, and increase profitability.

This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in unlocking insights from customer data and supports the creation of targeted marketing campaigns.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and normalized data to ensure accurate clustering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized relationships between income, age, and spending behavior.
Customer Segmentation: Applied K-Means clustering to categorize customers into 5 distinct segments.
Cluster Analysis: Examined the traits of each cluster, providing actionable insights for businesses.

Motivation
Understanding customers is essential for optimizing marketing strategies and delivering relevant offers. By identifying key customer segments, businesses can:

Target specific groups with personalized promotions.
Optimize product offerings based on customer spending habits.
Enhance customer satisfaction by addressing their unique needs.

Project Pipeline
Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and normalized features like Annual Income and Spending Score to ensure equal scaling across variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized the distribution of age, income, and spending scores across the customer base.
Analyzed correlations between variables to identify potential trends.
K-Means Clustering:

Applied the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Segmented customers into 5 distinct groups based on their behavior and demographics.
Cluster Interpretation:

Cluster 1: High-income young professionals with high spending—ideal for luxury products.
Cluster 2: Younger individuals with lower income but high spending potential—perfect for affordable, trendy products.
Cluster 3: Middle-aged high-income earners with low spending—best approached with value-driven products.
Cluster 4: Older, low-income individuals with minimal spending—suited for essential or budget-conscious products.
Cluster 5: Middle-aged, average-income individuals with balanced spending habits—great for mid-tier products.

Insights & Business Impact
This project showcases how businesses can:

Target marketing campaigns based on customer profiles (e.g., promoting luxury products to high-income, young professionals or offering discounts on essential goods to older, low-income customers).
Enhance customer engagement by delivering personalized offers.
Optimize product offerings to align with the spending behaviors and preferences of each segment.
For example:

A business selling luxury electronics could target Cluster 1 with ads for premium products like the latest iPhone.
A company focused on budget-conscious products could cater to Cluster 4, offering cost-effective, essential goods.

Technologies Used
Python: For data cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
Pandas: To manipulate and analyze customer data.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and exploration.
Scikit-learn: To implement the K-Means clustering algorithm.

Through K-Means clustering, the project segmented the customer base into 5 distinct clusters, each with unique spending behaviors and demographic profiles. These insights provide actionable information that businesses can use to tailor their marketing strategies and maximize customer engagement.

Conclusion
This customer segmentation project demonstrates the power of machine learning in extracting valuable insights from customer data. By understanding distinct customer segments, businesses can deliver more personalized and effective marketing campaigns, leading to better customer relationships and increased revenue.
